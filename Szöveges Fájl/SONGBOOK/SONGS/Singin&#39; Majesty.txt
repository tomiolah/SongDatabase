Singin&#39; Majesty

Singin&#39; Majesty, Majesty
Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty handed but alive in Your hands
We&#39;re singing Majesty, we&#39;re singing Majesty
Forever, forever I am changed by Your love
In the presence of Your Majesty


We&#39;re singing Majesty, Majesty
Your grace, Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty handed but alive in Your hands
We&#39;re singing Majesty, we&#39;re singing Majesty
Forever I am changed by Your love
In the presence of Your Majesty, Majesty


Majesty, Majesty
Your grace, Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty handed but alive in Your hands
Majesty, Majesty
Forever I am changed by Your love
In the presence of Your Majesty


We praise You, lift up a new song
Oh we praise You Lord, we bless Your name
You are the Father, You are the Father
Oh, we love You, we love You, we love You, oh oh
Oh, Hallelujah
Hallelujah
