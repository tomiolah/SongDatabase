Show Me Your Glory

Show me Your glory
Send down Your presence
I want to see Your face
Show me Your glory
Majesty shines about You
I can&#39;t go on without You, Lord


I caught a glimpse of Your splendor
In the corner of my eye
The most beautiful thing I&#39;ve ever seen
And it was like a flash of lightning
Reflected off the sky
And I know I&#39;ll never be the same


When I climb down the mountain
And get back to my life
I won&#39;t settle for ordinary things
I&#39;m gonna follow You forever
For all of my days
I won&#39;t rest &#39;til I see You again
