Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling

1. Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See on the portals He&#39;s waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me


Refren:
Come home, come home
Ye who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling, &quot;O sinner come home&quot;


2. O for the wonderful love He has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinned He has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me
