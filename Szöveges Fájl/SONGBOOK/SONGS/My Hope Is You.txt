My Hope Is You

My hope is You
Show me Your ways
Guide me in truth
In all my days
My hope is You


To You oh Lord I lift my soul
In You oh God I place my trust
And do not let me be put to shame
Don&#39;t let my enemies
Triumph over me


I am oh Lord filled with Your love
You are oh God my salvation
Well guard my life and rescue me
My broken spirit shouts
My mended heart cries out
