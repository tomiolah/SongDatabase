There Is None Like You

/: There is none like You
No one else can touch my heart like You do
I could search for all eternity long
And find there is none like You :/


Your mercy flows like a river wide
and healing comes from Your hand
Suffering children are safe in Your arms,
There is none like You


/: There is none like You
No one else can touch my heart like You do
I could search for all eternity long
And find there is none like You :/


Oh I could search for all eternity long
And find there is none
There is none
There is none like You
