Hallelujah, Salvation and Glory

Hallelujah, salvation and glory
Honor and power unto the Lord, our God


For the Lord, our God, is mighty
Yes, the Lord, our God is omnipotent
The Lord, our God, is wonderful


All praises be to the King of Kings
For the Lord, our God, is wonderful
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, He is wonderful
