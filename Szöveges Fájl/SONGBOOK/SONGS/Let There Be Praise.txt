Let There Be Praise

Let there be praise
Let there be joy in our hearts
Sing to the Lord
Give Him the glory
Let there be praise
Let there be joy in our hearts
Forevermore let His love fill the air
And let there be praise
Let there be praise


He inhabits the praise of His people
And dwells deep within
The peace that He gives none can equal
His love it knows no end
So lift your voices with gladness sing
Proclaim through all the earth
That Jesus Christ is King


When the Spirit of God is within us
We will overcome
In our weakness His strength will defend us
When His praise is on our tongue
So lift your voices with gladness sing
Proclaim through all the earth
That Jesus Christ is King
