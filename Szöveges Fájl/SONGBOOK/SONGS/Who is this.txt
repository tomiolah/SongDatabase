Who is this

Who is this that appears like the dawn
Fairer than the moon, brighter than the sun
You&#39;re the lover of my soul
Draw me into You, draw me into You


Who is this that beckons me to come close
Beauty beyond words surrounds me when You&#39;re near
You&#39;re the lover of my soul
Draw me into You, draw me into You


We will run, we will fly, we will be together
We will laugh, we will cry, we will be together


Who is this that wipes the tears from my eyes
Just one glimpse of You steals my heart away
You&#39;re the lover of my soul
Draw me into You, draw me into You


We will run, we will fly, we will be together
We will laugh, we will cry, we will be together


Draw me into You, draw me into You
