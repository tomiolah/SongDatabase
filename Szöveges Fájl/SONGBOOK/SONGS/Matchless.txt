Matchless

Your name is matchless
Your name is priceless
Your name means more
Than I could know
You&#39;re so far above me
The way that You love me
Goes further than any love could go


Son of Man Great I Am
King of Heaven Son of God
You hold the measure of my days
Holy Lamb spotless Lamb
You are worthy I am not
Before Your throne I stand amazed


Every tongue confess
And every knee will bow
To Jesus Christ the Lord forever
Hear our praises now


Wonderful Counselor
Root of David Morning Star
You are the Way the Truth the Life
Lion of the tribe of Judah
Mighty God is who You are
The only perfect sacrifice


BRIDGE
In Your name You took the blind man
And You gave him back his sight
In Your name You took the dead man
And You brought him back to life
In Your name You took this prisoner
And You opened up the doors
And I will sing before Your throne forever more
