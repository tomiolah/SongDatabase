Song Of Worship

I will enter His gates with thanksgiving
I will enter His courts with praise
I will lift up a song of worship
I will bless His holy name


Our Lord God is so holy
Mighty in all of His ways
Our Lord God is so worthy
Worthy of all our praise


He is the One Who has given
Given my heart a brand new song
I will sing to Him in worship
Praising Him all day long


I will lift up a song of worship
I will bless His holy name
I will enter His gates with Thanksgiving
I will bless His Holy name
