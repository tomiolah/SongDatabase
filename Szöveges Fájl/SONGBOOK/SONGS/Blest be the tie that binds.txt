Blest be the tie that binds

Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship our spirit finds
Is like to that above.


Before our Fatherâ€™s throne,
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one
Our comforts and our cares.


We share our mutual woes;
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.


When we asunder part,
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.


From sorrow, toil, and pain,
And sin we shall be free;
And perfect love and oneness reign
Through all eternity.
