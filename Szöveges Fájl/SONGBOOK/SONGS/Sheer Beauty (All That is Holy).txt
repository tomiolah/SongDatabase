Sheer Beauty (All That is Holy)

Here in your presence
I fall to my knees
I’m overcome
I’m overcome
I am defeated
You conquer me
With your love
With your love


I raise my hands in surrender
You have captured my heart


You are sheer beauty
Absolute glory
Consummate mercy
Incomparable grace
Infinite power
Unchanging wonder
Everything worthy
Of undying praise
All that is holy
All that is holy
All that is holy
You are sheer beauty


Here in your presence
You speak my name
I come undone
I come undone
All of my worship and
All of my praise
Is not enough
Is not enough


I raise my hands in surrender
You have captured my heart
