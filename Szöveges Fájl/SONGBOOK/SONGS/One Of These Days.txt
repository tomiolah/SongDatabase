One Of These Days

One of these days
I&#39;m gonna see the hand
That took the nails for me
One of these days
I&#39;m gonna hold the key
Of the mansion built for me


One of these days
I&#39;m gonna walk the streets of gold
That were paved for me
One of these days
I&#39;m gonna see my Savior face to face
One of these days


One of these days I&#39;m gonna fly
Over the mountain
One of these days I&#39;m gonna ride
On the silver lining
One of these days I&#39;m gonna witness
All I&#39;ve been missing
One of these days


One of these days I&#39;m gonna do
All the things that I&#39;ve never done
I&#39;m gonna finish all the races
That I&#39;ve run but I&#39;ve never won
And I&#39;m gonna see a million faces
And recognize everyone
One of these days


One of these days I&#39;m gonna say
Just what became of me
On the day that I believed
When You took myself from me
And I believe I will say
What I would have been
If You didn&#39;t save me
One of these days


And one of these days I&#39;m gonna talk
With all the saints
That have gone before
And in their sandals I will walk
And we will sit along the shore
And I will learn all the things
That I never knew before
All this and more


Bridge
One of these days I&#39;ll finally be
In a place where
There&#39;s no more need
No more pain and no more grief
No more foolish disbelief
And all the joy there will be
When at last we finally see
One of these days
