As the deer pants for the water

As the deer pants for the water,
So my soul longs after You.
You alone are my heart&#39;s desire
And I long to worship You.


You alone are my strength my shield.
To You alone may my spirit yield.
You alone are my heart&#39;s desire
And I long to worship You.


You&#39;re my friend and you are my brother,
Even though You are a King.
I love you more than any other,
So much more than anything.


I want You more than gold or silver,
Only You can satisfy.
You alone are the real joy-giver
And the apple of my eye.
