I See You

And everywhere I go I see You
And everywhere I go I see You
And everywhere I go I see You
And everywhere I go I see You


Lord You&#39;re leading me
With a cloud by day
And then in the night
The glow of a burning flame


And You take my hand
And You wash it clean
I know the promised land
Is light years ahead of me


And the eagle flies
And the rivers run
I look through the night
And I can see the rising sun


Well the grass will die
And the flowers fall
But Your Word&#39;s alive
And it will be after all
