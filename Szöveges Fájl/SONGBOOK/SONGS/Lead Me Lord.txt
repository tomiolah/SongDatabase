Lead Me Lord

Lead me Lord I will follow
Lead me Lord I will go
You have called me I will answer
Lead me Lord I will go


It&#39;s hard to take the first step
When I don&#39;t know the way
Each turn is so uncertain
I learn to walk by faith
But You gave me a promise
That You would never leave
You will lead and guide me
Oh Lord I do believe


Your plans for me are perfect
I never need to fear
For though at times I feel alone
I know that You are near
My heart just wants to follow
I&#39;m willing to obey
Take my hand and lead me
I&#39;ll follow all the way


ENDING
You have called me I will answer
Lead me Lord I will go
You have called me I will answer
Lead me Lord Lord I will go
Lead me Lord
