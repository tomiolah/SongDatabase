Mansion Over The Hilltop

I&#39;m satisfied
With just a cottage below
A little silver
And a little gold
But in that city
Where the ransomed will shine
I want a gold one
That&#39;s silver lined


I&#39;ve got a mansion
Just over the hilltop
In that bright land
Where we&#39;ll never grow old
And someday yonder
We&#39;ll never more wander
But walk the streets
That are purest gold


Don&#39;t think me poor
Or deserted or lonely
I&#39;m not discouraged
I&#39;m heaven bound
I&#39;m just a pilgrim
In search of a city
I want a mansion
A harp and a crown


Tho&#39; often tempted
Tormented and tested
And like the prophet
My pillow&#39;s a stone
And tho&#39; I find here
No permanent dwelling
I know He&#39;ll give me
A mansion my own
