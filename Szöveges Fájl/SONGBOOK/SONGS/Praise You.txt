Praise You

Praise You praise You praise You
Let my life praise You
Praise You praise You praise You
Let my life O Lord praise You


Lord I come to You today
With a simple prayer to pray
In everything I do
Let my life O Lord praise You


Lord You formed me out of clay
For Your glory I was made
Use this vessel as You choose
Let my life O Lord praise You
