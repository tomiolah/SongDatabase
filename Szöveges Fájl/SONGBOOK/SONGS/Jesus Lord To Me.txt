Jesus Lord To Me

Jesus Jesus Lord to me
Master Savior Prince of Peace
Ruler of my heart today
Jesus Lord to me (to me)


If I had seen the sunset
On the day that Jesus died
And felt the glow of the sunrise
When the tomb was opened wide
Would I have known You
Would I have seen that
You were more than just a man
You were Lord and King
But now I know You and I can see
That You are Lord of all
You are Lord to me
