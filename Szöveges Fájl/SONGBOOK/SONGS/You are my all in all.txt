You are my all in all

You are my strength when I am weak
You are the treasure that I seek
You are my all in all.
Seeking you as a precious jewel
Lord to give up I&#39;d be a fool
You are my all in all.
Chorus:
Jesus, lamb of God,
worthy is your name,
Jesus, lamb of God,
worthy is your name.


Taking my sin my cross my shame
Rising again I bless your name
You are my all in all.
When I fall down you pick me up
When I am dry you fill my cup
You are my all in all.
Chorus:
Jesus, lamb of God,
worthy is your name,
Jesus, lamb of God,
worthy is your name.
