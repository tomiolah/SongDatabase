My Passion

You alone are my passion forever
Song of my soul Desire of my heart
You alone are my passion my treasure
I love You for all that You are


To the ends of the earth I will follow
There&#39;s nothing that I will not do
You alone are my reason for living
Jesus my passion is You
Jesus my passion is You


My life O Jesus
My love
You are my passion
My God my passion
My passion
You are my life
O Jesus my love
You are my passion
My God
My passion
My passion
