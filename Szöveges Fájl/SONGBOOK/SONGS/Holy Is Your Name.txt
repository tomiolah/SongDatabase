Holy Is Your Name

Now I want to say
Holy is Your name
Let all creation proclaim
Holy is Your name


Now I praise You Lord of all creation
You ordain the sun to rise and fall
You scatter the stars across the heavens
You come close enough to hear me call


Your love is the shelter over my soul
You fill me with the wonder of a child
You will heal the humble and the broken
Mercy flows like a river running wild


BRIDGE
On the highest mountain
I will lift my heart to the sky
From the lowest valley
Hear my cry
