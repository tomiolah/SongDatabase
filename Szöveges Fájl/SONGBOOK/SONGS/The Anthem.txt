The Anthem

I can hear the footsteps of my King
I can hear His heartbeat beckoning
In my darkness He has set me free
And now I hear the Spirit calling me


/: He&#39;s calling
Wake up child
It&#39;s your time to shine
You were born for such a time as this :/


I can hear a holy rumbling
I&#39;ve begun to preach another King
Loosing chains and breaking down the walls
I want to hear the Father when He calls


/: He&#39;s calling
Wake up child
It&#39;s your time to shine
You were born for such a time as this :/


/: This is the anthem of our generation
Here we are God
Shake our nation
All we need is Your love
You captivate me :/


/: I am royalty
I have destiny
I have been set free
I&#39;m gonna shape history :/


I&#39;m gonna change the world
