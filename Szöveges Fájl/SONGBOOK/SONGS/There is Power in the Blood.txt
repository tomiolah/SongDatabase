There is Power in the Blood

1. Would you be free from the burden of sin?
There&#39;s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Would you o&#39;er evil a victory win?
There&#39;s wonderful power in the blood.


Chorus:
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb.
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb.


2. Would you be free from your passion and pride?
There&#39;s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Come for a cleansing to Calvary&#39;s tide;
There&#39;s wonderful power in the blood.


3. Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?
There&#39;s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Sin stains are lost in its life giving flow;
There&#39;s wonderful power in the blood.


4. Would you do service for Jesus your King?
There&#39;s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Would you live daily His praises to sing?
There&#39;s wonderful power in the blood.
