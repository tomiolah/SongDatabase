Even So Come

All of creation
All of the earth
Make straight a highway
A path for the Lord
Jesus is coming soon


Call back the sinner
Wake up the saint
Let every nation shout of Your fame
Jesus is coming soon


Like a bride waiting for her groom
We&#39;ll be a Church ready for You
Every heart longing for our King
We sing &quot;even so come&quot;
Lord Jesus, come
Even so come
Lord Jesus, come


There will be justice, all will be new
Your name forever, faithful and true
Jesus is coming soon


Oh, like a bride waiting for her groom
We&#39;ll be a Church ready for You
Every heart longing for our King
We sing &quot;even so come&quot;
Lord Jesus, come
Even so come
Lord Jesus, come


/: So we wait
We wait for You
God, we wait
You&#39;re coming soon :/


Like a bride waiting for her groom
We&#39;ll be at Church, ready for You
Every heart longing for our King, we sing


Like a bride waiting for her groom
We&#39;ll be at Church, we&#39;ll be ready for You
Every heart longing for our King, we sing &quot;even so come&quot;
Lord Jesus, come


/: Even so come
Lord Jesus, come. :/ 3x
