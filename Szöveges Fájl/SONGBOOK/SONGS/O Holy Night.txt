O Holy Night

O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the our Saviour&#39;s birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
&#39;Til He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.


Fall on your knees! O hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born.


Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in His name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name.


Christ is the Lord! O Praise His name forever.
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born.


Fall on your knees! O hear the angels&#39; voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born.


Christ is the Lord! O Praise His name forever.
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born.
