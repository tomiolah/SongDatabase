Draw me close to you

Draw me close to you
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear you say that I&#39;m your friend.


You are my desire
No one else will do
Cause nothing else can take your place
To feel the warmth of your embrace


Help me find the way
Bring me back to you


You&#39;re all I want
You&#39;re all I&#39;ve ever needed


You&#39;re all I want
Help me know you are near
