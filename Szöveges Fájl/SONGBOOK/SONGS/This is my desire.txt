This is my desire

This is my desire: to honor You.
Lord with all my heart I worship You.
All I have within me, I give You praise.
All that I adore is in You.


Lord I give You my heart,
I give You my soul, I live for You alone.
Every breath that I take,
Every moment I&#39;m awake,
Lord have Your way in me.
