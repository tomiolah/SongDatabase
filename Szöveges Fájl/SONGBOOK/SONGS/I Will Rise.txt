I Will Rise

There&#39;s a peace I&#39;ve come to know
Though my heart and flesh may fail
There&#39;s an anchor for my soul
I can say &quot;It is well&quot;


Jesus has overcome
And the grave is overwhelmed
The victory is won
He is risen from the dead


And I will rise when He calls my name
No more sorrow, no more pain
I will rise on eagles&#39; wings
Before my God fall on my knees
And rise
I will rise


There&#39;s a day that&#39;s drawing near
When this darkness breaks to light
And the shadows disappear
And my faith shall be my eyes


Jesus has overcome
And the grave is overwhelmed
The victory is won
He is risen from the dead


And I will rise when He calls my name
No more sorrow, no more pain
I will rise on eagles&#39; wings
Before my God fall on my knees
And rise
I will rise


/: And I hear the voice of many angels sing,
&quot;Worthy is the Lamb&quot;
And I hear the cry of every longing heart,
&quot;Worthy is the Lamb&quot; :/


I will rise when He calls my name
No more sorrow, no more pain
I will rise on eagles&#39; wings
Before my God fall on my knees
And rise
I will rise
