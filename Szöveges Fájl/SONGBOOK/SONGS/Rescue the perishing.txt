Rescue the perishing

1. Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
weep o&#39;er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.


Refrain:
Rescue the perishing,
care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.


2. Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting,
waiting the penitent child to receive;
plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently.
He will forgive if they only believe.


3. Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter,
feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
touched by a loving heart, wakened by kindness,
chords that are broken will vibrate once more.


4. Rescue the perishing, duty demands it.
Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
back to the narrow way patiently win them,
tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.
