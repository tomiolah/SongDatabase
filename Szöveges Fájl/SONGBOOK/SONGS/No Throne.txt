No Throne

Who is there Jesus
That reigns above you?
Who has the power and
Wisdom you do?


You rule forever
You’re seated on high
I fall before you
My spirit cries there is


No throne
Higher than your throne
No kingdom
Greater than yours
There is no throne
Higher than your throne
You are Lord


You gaze with love upon
All hearts of faith
You show such mercy
Compassion and grace


Yet there’s perfect justice at
Your judgement seat
All kings and nations are
Under your feet there is


Bridge
Lord of all Lords King of all Kings
Now and forever the universe sings
Lord of all Lords King of all Kings
With all creation your children sing
