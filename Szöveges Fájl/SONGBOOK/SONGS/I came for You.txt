I came for You

All it takes is one moment
And just one touch from You.
I put aside all distractions,
Cause I came for You, I came for You.


I need You more than ever,
Nothing else satisfies.
All my life I surrender.
I&#39;ll live for You, I&#39;ll live for You.
I came for You, I came for You.


Holy Spirit You are welcome,
Come and move upon this place.
We desire an encounter once again.
Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit.


Now that my heart is open,
I am ready for You.
Jesus take me deeper.
I came for You, I came for You.
I came for You, I came for You.


Holy Spirit You are welcome,
Come and move upon this place.
We desire an encounter once again.


Send your fire, release your power,
So we&#39;ll never be the same.
We desire an encounter once again.


We make way, we make room,
Lord let your spirit move.
Have your way in this place,
Lord we have come for you.


We make way, we make room,
Lord let your spirit move.
Have your way in this place,
Lord we have come for you.


We make way, we make room,
Lord let your spirit move.
Have your way in this place,
Lord we have come for you.


Holy Spirit You are welcome,
Come and move upon this place.
We desire an encounter once again.


Send your fire, release your power,
So we&#39;ll never be the same.
We desire an encounter once again.
Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit.
Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit.


We make way, we make room,
Lord let your spirit move.
Have your way in this place,
Lord we have come for you.
