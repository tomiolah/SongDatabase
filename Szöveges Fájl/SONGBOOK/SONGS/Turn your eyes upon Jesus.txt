Turn your eyes upon Jesus

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in his wonderful face.
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
in the light of his glory and grace.


Turn your eyes upon Jesus
for all of our life is in him.
To know him always as way and truth
is how melting all sorrow and sin.


Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Bow down before his throne of grace.
This king of glory is coming again
To take the waits, trusting in him.
