Once again

Jesus Christ, I think upon your sacrifice
You became nothing, poured out to death
Many times I&#39;ve wondered at your gift of life
And I&#39;m in that place once again
I&#39;m in that place once again


And once again I look upon the cross where you died
I&#39;m humbled by your mercy and I&#39;m broken inside
Once again I thank you
Once again I pour out my life


Now you are exalted to the highest place
King of the heavens, where one day I&#39;ll bow
But for now I marvel at your saving grace
And I&#39;m full of praise once again
Full of praise today
I&#39;m full of praise once again


Thank you for the cross
Thank you for the cross
Thank you for the cross, my friend
