No Longer Slaves

You unravel me with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance from my enemies
&#39;Til all my fears are gone


/: I&#39;m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God :/


From my mother&#39;s womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I&#39;ve been born again to my family
Your blood flows through my veins


/: I&#39;m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God :/ 4x


I am surrounded
By the arms of the Father
I am surrounded
By songs of deliverance


We&#39;ve been liberated
From our bondage
We&#39;re the sons and the daughters
Let us sing our freedom


/: You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
My fears are drowned in perfect love
You rescued me
And I will stand and sing
I am a child of God. :/


Yes, I am
I am a child of God
I am a child of God
Yes, I am
I am a child of God
Full of faith
Yes, I am a child of God
I am a child of God


/: I&#39;m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God :/ 3x
