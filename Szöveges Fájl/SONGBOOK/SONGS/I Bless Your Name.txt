I Bless Your Name

I want to stay
here in this place
Resting in your everlasting arms
There’s nothing as great as
praising your name
Lifting up the name of Jesus Christ
As I behold your wondrous love


I will forever glorify the King of Heaven
It’s my joy, my life to praise your name
Nothing could ever separate me
from the love I’ve found in You
I bless your name
