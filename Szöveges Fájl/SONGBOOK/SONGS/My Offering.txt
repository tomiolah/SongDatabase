My Offering

Here in my heart
Forever grateful
Is all my love
Forever faithful
Lord You&#39;re all I have all I need all I want


My dearest friend
My true companion
You took me in
Lost and abandoned
Lord You&#39;re all I have all I need all I want


And this is just a token of devotion
To heaven&#39;s love as deep as any ocean


All my life all my breath every word every step
Every beat of my heart will sing
Every joy every fear every smile every tear
Is the least that my soul can bring
It&#39;s my offering


I can&#39;t explain
This transformation
But by Your Spirit
I&#39;m awakened
Lord You&#39;re all I have all I need all I want


I can&#39;t repay
So great a mercy
Poured out each day
But I am learning
Lord You&#39;re all I have all I need all I want
