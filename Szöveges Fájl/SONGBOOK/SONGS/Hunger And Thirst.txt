Hunger And Thirst

I hunger and thirst for You
I hunger and thirst for You
In the desert of my need
You&#39;re the fountain that I seek
You&#39;re the Living Water I keep running to
I hunger and thirst for You
I hunger and thirst for You


I hunger and thirst for You
I hunger and thirst for You
Heaven&#39;s Manna Bread of Life
Fill the emptiness inside
Nothing else can satisfy me like You do
I hunger and thirst for You
I hunger and thirst for You
