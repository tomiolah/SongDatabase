On My Cross

How wide is Your love
That You would stretch Your arms
And go around the world
And why for me
Would a Savior&#39;s cry be heard
I don&#39;t know
Why You went where I was meant to go
I don&#39;t know why You love me so


Those were my nails, that was my crown
That pierced Your hands and Your brow
Those were my thorns, those were my scorns
Those were my tears that fell down
And just as You said it would be
You did it all for me
And after You counted the cost
You took my shame, my blame on my cross


How deep is Your grace
That You could see my need
And choose to take my place
And then for me
These words I&#39;d hear You say
Father no
Forgive them for they know not what they do
I will go because I love them so
