Unto The Lamb 

I can see Jesus, high and exalted
My eyes are fixed upon his face
It shines like the sun.


I can see Jesus, clothed in glory
He is high and lifted up,
And his train fills the temple.


All of the angels cry, “Holy”.
All the saints cry, “Holy”.
All of creation cries “Holy”.
Holy is the lamb.


All praise unto the lamb
Who sits on the throne
Honor and Power, dominion and Praise
Unto the Lamb, who was and is
And is to come.


Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
