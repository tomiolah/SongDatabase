Learning To Lean

Learning to lean
Learning to lean
I&#39;m learning to lean on Jesus
Finding more power
Than I&#39;d ever dreamed
I&#39;m learning to lean on Jesus


Sad broken hearted so often I&#39;ve knelt
And I&#39;ve found God&#39;s peace so serene
And all that He asks is a child-like trust
And a heart that is learning to lean


The joy I can&#39;t explain fills my soul
Since the day I made Jesus my King
His blessed Holy Spirit is leading my way
He&#39;s teaching and I&#39;m learning to lean


Sometimes we can be like the man who said
My life is full now I have ev&#39;rything
But there is a strong Rock in Jesus my Lord
Thro&#39; my trials I&#39;ve been learning to lean


There&#39;s glorious vict&#39;ry each day now for me
I found His peace so serene
He helps me with each task if only I&#39;ll ask
Ev&#39;ry day now I&#39;m learning to lean
