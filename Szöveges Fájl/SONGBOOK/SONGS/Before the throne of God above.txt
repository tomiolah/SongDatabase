Before the throne of God above

Before the throne of God above,
I have a strong, a perfect plea,
A great High Priest whose name is &quot;Love,&quot;
Who ever lives and pleads for me.


My name is graven on His hands,
My name is written on His heart;
I know that while in heav&#39;n He stands
no tongue can bid me thence depart.
No tongue can bid me thence depart.


When Satan tempts me to despair,
and tells me of the guilt within,
upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin.


Because the sinless Saviour died,
my sinful soul is counted free;
For God, the Just, is satisfied
to look on him and par don me.
to look on him and par don me.


Behold him there! the risen Lamb,
my perfect, spotless Righteousness,
the great unchange a ble I AM,
the King of glory and of grace!


One with Himself I cannot die,
My soul is purchased by His blood;
My life is hid with Christ on high,
with Christ, my Saviour and my God
with Christ, my Saviour and my God
