Send The Wind

I need revival, I need repentance
I need a new start, I need a brand new heart
More of You, I need more of You


Send the wind, send the wind
send the fire once again
Let it fall down on us here
as we lift up holy hands
Send the wind, send the wind
send the fire once again
Everything in us will change
as our hearts you innovate


I need passion, I need purpose
I need forgiveness, I need courageous faith
More of You, I need more of You
