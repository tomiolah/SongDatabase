Knowing You, Jesus

All I once held dear, built my life upon
All this world reveres and wants to own
All I once thought gain, I have counted loss
Spent and worthless now, compared to this


Knowing You, Jesus, knowing You
There is no greater thing
You&#39;re my all, You&#39;re the best
You&#39;re my joy, my righteousness
And I love You, Lord


Now my heart&#39;s desire is to know You more
To be found in You and known as Yours
To possess by faith what I could not earn
All-surpassing gift of righteousness


Knowing You, Jesus, knowing You
There is no greater thing
You&#39;re my all, You&#39;re the best
You&#39;re my joy, my righteousness
And I love You, Lord


Oh to know the power of Your risen life
And to know You in Your sufferings
To become like You in Your death, my Lord
So with You to live and never die


Knowing You, Jesus, knowing You
There is no greater thing
You&#39;re my all, You&#39;re the best
You&#39;re my joy, my righteousness
You&#39;re my all, You&#39;re the best
You&#39;re my joy, my righteousness
You&#39;re my all, You&#39;re the best
You&#39;re my joy, my righteousness
And I love You, Lord


You&#39;re my all, You&#39;re the best
You&#39;re my joy, my righteousness
And I love You, Lord
