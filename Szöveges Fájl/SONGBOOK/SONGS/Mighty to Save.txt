Mighty to Save

Everyone needs compassion
A love that&#39;s never failing, let mercy fall on me
Everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a Savior, the Hope of nations.


Savior, He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save.
He is mighty to save.
Forever, author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave.
Jesus conquered the grave.


So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures.
Fill my life again.
I give my life to follow everything I believe in.
Now I surrender. (I surrender.)


Savior, He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save.
He is mighty to save.
Forever, author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave.
Jesus conquered the grave.


Shine Your light and let the whole world see
We&#39;re singing for the glory of the risen King, Jesus


Shine Your light and let the whole world see
We&#39;re singing for the glory of the risen King.


Singin&#39; Majesty, Majesty
Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty handed but alive in Your hands


We&#39;re singing Majesty, we&#39;re singing Majesty
Forever, forever I am changed by Your love
In the presence of Your Majesty


Savior, He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save.
He is mighty to save.
Forever, author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave.
Jesus conquered the grave.
