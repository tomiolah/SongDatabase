Jesus You&#39;re The Answer

Jesus Jesus You&#39;re the answer
To all I&#39;m searching for
Jesus Jesus there&#39;s no question
You&#39;re what my heart is longing for


You&#39;re my hope You&#39;re my strength
You&#39;re my peace in the stormy sea
You&#39;re my life my very source
My guiding light wherever I may go


BRIDGE
You&#39;re what my heart is longing for
