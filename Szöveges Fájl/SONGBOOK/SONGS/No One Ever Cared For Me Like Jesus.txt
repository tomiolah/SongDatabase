No One Ever Cared For Me Like Jesus

No one ever cared for me like Jesus
There&#39;s no other friend so kind as He
No one else could take the sin
And darkness from me
O how much He cared for me


I would love to tell you
What I think of Jesus
Since I found in Him
A friend so strong and true
I would tell you how
He changed my life completely
He did something
That no other friend could do


All my life was full of sin
When Jesus found me
All my heart was full
Of misery and woe
Jesus placed His strong
And loving arms around me
And He led me in the way
I ought to go


Ev&#39;ry day He comes to me
With new assurance
More and more I understand
His words of love
But I&#39;ll never know
Just why He came to save me
Till someday I see
His blessed face above
