Do Lord

Do Lord, oh, do Lord, oh, do remember me,
Do Lord, oh, do Lord, oh, do remember me,
Do Lord, oh, do Lord, oh, do remember me,
Look away beyond the blue.


I&#39;ve got a home in glory land, that outshines the sun
I&#39;ve got a home in glory land, that outshines the sun
I&#39;ve got a home in glory land, that outshines the sun
Look away beyond the blue.


I took Jesus as my Savior, you take Him too,
I took Jesus as my Savior, you take Him too,
I took Jesus as my Savior, you take Him too,
Look away beyond the blue.


I read about it in the book of revelation, you read it, too
I read about it in the book of revelation, you read it, too
I read about it in the book of revelation, you read it, too
Look away beyond the blue.
