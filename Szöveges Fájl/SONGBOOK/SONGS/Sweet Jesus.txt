Sweet Jesus

Sweet Jesus my Savior you are my faithful friend
You made me
you know me
you’ve seen my every sin


My soul is amazed
By the gift of your grace
And the arms that take me
Sweet Jesus my Savior you are my faithful friend


Sweet Jesus my shelter you are my faithful friend
The refuge I run to when the world comes closing in


Why should I be afraid
When I know I am saved
By the arms that take me in
Sweet Jesus my shelter you are my faithful friend


Sweet Jesus my shepherd you are my faithful friend
You hold me you lead me I’ll follow to the end


And once more I will say
On that beautiful day
When your arms take me in
Sweet Jesus my shepherd you are my faithful friend
Sweet Jesus my Savior you are my faithful friend
