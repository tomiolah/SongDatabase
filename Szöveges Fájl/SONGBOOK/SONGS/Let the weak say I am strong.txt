Let the weak say I am strong

Let the weak say, &quot;I am strong&quot;
Let the poor say, &quot;I am rich&quot;
Let the blind say, &quot;I can see&quot;
It&#39;s what the lord has done in me


Hosanna, hosanna
To the lamb that was slain
Hosanna, hosanna
Jesus died and rose again


Into the river I will wade
And there my sins are washed away
From the heavens mercy streams
Of the savior&#39;s love for me


And I will rise from waters deep
Into the saving arms of god
And I will sing salvation songs
Jesus christ has set me free
