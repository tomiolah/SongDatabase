You shine

Why should I fear man when You made the heavens
Why should I be afraid when You put the stars in place
Why should I lose heart when I know how great You are
Why should I give up when Your plans are full of love


In this world we will have trouble
But You have overcome the world


You shine brighter than the brightest star
Your love purer than the purest heart
You shine filling us with courage and strength to follow You


Why should I fear man when You made the heavens
Why should I be afraid when You put the stars in place
Why should I lose heart when I know how great You are
Why should I give up when Your plans are full of love


In this world we will have trouble
But You have overcome the world
But You have overcome the world
