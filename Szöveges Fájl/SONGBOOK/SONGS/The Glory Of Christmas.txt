The Glory Of Christmas

O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight


And the Glory of Christmas, is the Glory of Christ
And the Glory of Christmas, is the Glory of His love


O holy child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord in Emmanuel


And the Glory of Christmas, is the Glory of Christ
And the Glory of Christmas, is the Glory of His love
Oh the story of his love, his love, his love for us
Oh the story of his love


How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven
No ear may hear his coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive him still
The dear Christ enters in
O Christ be welcomed in


And the Glory of Christmas, is the Glory of Christ
And the Glory of Christmas, is the Glory of His love


All the Glory of Christmas, is the Glory of Christ
All the Glory of Christmas
The story of his love
The story of his love
The story of his love
