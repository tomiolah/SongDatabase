Down to the river to pray

As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Good Lord, show me the way!


O sisters, let&#39;s go down,
Let&#39;s go down, come on down
O sisters, let&#39;s go down
Down in the river to pray


As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the robe and crown
Good Lord, show me the way!


O brothers, let&#39;s go down
Let&#39;s go down, come on down
Come on, brothers, let&#39;s go down
Down in the river to pray


As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Good Lord, show me the way!


O fathers, let&#39;s go down
Let&#39;s go down, come on down
O fathers, let&#39;s go down
Down in the river to pray


As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the robe and crown
Good Lord, show me the way!


O mothers, let&#39;s go down
Let&#39;s go down; don&#39;t you want to go down?
Come on, mothers, let&#39;s go down
Down in the river to pray


As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the starry crown
Good Lord, show me the way!


O sinners, let&#39;s go down
Let&#39;s go down, come on down
O sinners, let&#39;s go down
Down in the river to pray


As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good old way
And who shall wear the robe and crown
Good Lord, show me the way!
