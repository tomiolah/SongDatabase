I&#39;d rather have Jesus

1. I&#39;d rather have Jesus than silver or gold;
I&#39;d rather be His than have riches untold;
I&#39;d rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
I&#39;d rather be led by His nail pierced hand.


Chorus:
Than to be the king of a vast domain
Or be held in sin&#39;s dread sway.
I&#39;d rather have Jesus than anything
This world affords today.


2. I&#39;d rather have Jesus than men&#39;s applause;
I&#39;d rather be faithful to His dear cause;
I&#39;d rather have Jesus than worldwide fame.
I&#39;d rather be true to His holy name.


3. He&#39;s fairer than lilies of rarest bloom;
He&#39;s sweeter than honey from out the comb;
He&#39;s all that my hungering spirit needs.
I&#39;d rather have Jesus and let Him lead.
