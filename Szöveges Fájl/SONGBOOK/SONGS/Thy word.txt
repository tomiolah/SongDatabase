Thy word

/: Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path. :/


When I feel afraid, think I&#39;ve lost my way
Still you&#39;re there right beside me
And nothing will I fear, as long as You are near
Please be near me to the end


/: Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path. :/


I will not forget, Your love for me and yet
My heart forever is wandering
Jesus be my guide, and hold me to Your side
I will love You to the end


/: Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path. :/


Nothing will I fear, as long as You are near
Please be near me to the end


Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path
And a light unto my path
You&#39;re the light unto my path
