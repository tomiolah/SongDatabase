In Christ alone I place my trust

In Christ alone I place my trust
And find my glory in the power of the cross
In ev&#39;ry victory let it be said of me
My source of strength my source of hope
Is Christ alone


In Christ alone will I glory
Though I could pride myself in battles won
For I&#39;ve been blessed beyond measure
And by His strength alone I overcome
Oh I could stop and count successes
Like diamonds in my hand
But those trophies could not equal
To the grace by which I stand


In Christ alone will I glory
For only by His grace I am redeemed
And only His tender mercy
Could reach beyond my weakness to my need
Now I seek no greater honor
Than just to know Him more
And to count my gains
But losses to the glory of my Lord
