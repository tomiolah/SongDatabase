Thank You Lord

Thank You Lord for saving my soul
Thank You Lord for making me whole
Thank You Lord for giving to me
Thy great salvation so rich and free


Some thank the Lord for friends and home
For mercies sure and sweet
But I would praise Him for His grace
In prayer I would repeat


Some thank Him for the flow&#39;rs that grow
Some for the stars that shine
My heart is filled with joy and praise
Because I know He&#39;s mine


I trust in Him from day to day
I prove His saving grace
I&#39;ll sing this song of praise to Him
Until I see His face
