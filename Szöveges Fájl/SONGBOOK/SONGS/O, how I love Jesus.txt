O, how I love Jesus

There is a name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in mine ear,
The sweetest name on earth.


O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me!


It tells me of a Savior&#39;s love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner&#39;s perfect plea.


It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below.
