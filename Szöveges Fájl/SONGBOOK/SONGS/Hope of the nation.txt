Hope of the nation

Jesus, hope of the nations
Jesus, comfort for all who mourn
You are the source of Heaven&#39;s hope on earth
Jesus, light in the darkness


Jesus, truth in each circumstance
You are the source of Heaven&#39;s light on earth
In history You lived and died
You broke the chains, You rose to life


You are the hope living in us
You are the rock in whom we trust
You are the light shining for all the world to see


You rose from the dead conquering fear
Our Prince of Peace drawing us near
Jesus our hope, living for all who will receive
Lord, we believe


Lord, we believe
Lord, we believe
In history You lived and died
You broke the chains, You rose to life


Lord, we believe
(Jesus, hope of the nations)
Lord, we believe
(Jesus, hope of the nations)
Lord, we believe
