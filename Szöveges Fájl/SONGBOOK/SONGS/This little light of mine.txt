This little light of mine

This little light of mine, I&#39;m gonna let it shine
This little light of mine, I&#39;m gonna let it shine
This little light of mine, I&#39;m gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine!


Jesus is the light, I’m gonna let Him shine
Jesus is the light, I’m gonna let Him shine
Jesus is the light, I’m gonna let Him shine
Let Him shine, let Him shine, let Him shine


I will stomp my feet, and I will clap my hands and shout,
shout
I will run around, and I&#39;ll jump off the ground and
shout, shout
I will stomp my feet, I will clap my hands and shout,
shout
I will run around, and I&#39;ll jump off the ground and
shout, shout


This little light of mine, I&#39;m gonna let it shine
This little light of mine, I&#39;m gonna let it shine
This little light of mine, I&#39;m gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine!
