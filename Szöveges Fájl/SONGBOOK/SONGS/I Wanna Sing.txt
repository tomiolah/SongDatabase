I Wanna Sing

I wanna sing of Your mercy
I wanna sing of Your love
And tell the world I&#39;m grateful
For everything that You have done
I wanna sing of Your kindness
Wanna share the good news
As long as I can sing
I wanna sing about You


Grace so amazing
I can hardly understand
How You forgive me
And accept me as I am
I can&#39;t believe the way
You work in my life
I would be crazy
If I kept this all inside


Hope for tomorrow
And a passion for today
Joy in the sorrow
&#39;Cause You&#39;re with me all the way
Oh and You gave Your life
To show that You care
This is the music
That I want so much to share


Bridge
I want to make a difference
Want to rise above the noise
With the kind of words I choose to use
Each time I lift my voice
