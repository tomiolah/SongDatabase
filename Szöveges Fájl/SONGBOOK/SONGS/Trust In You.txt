Trust In You

Letting go of every single dream
I lay each one down at Your feet
Every moment of my wandering
Never changes what You see


I&#39;ve tried to win this war I confess
My hands are weary I need Your rest
Mighty Warrior, King of the fight
No matter what I face, You&#39;re by my side


When You don&#39;t move the mountains I&#39;m needing You to move
When You don&#39;t part the waters I wish I could walk through
When You don&#39;t give the answers as I cry out to You
I will trust, I will trust, I will trust in You!


Truth is, You know what tomorrow brings
There&#39;s not a day ahead You have not seen
So, in all things be my life and breath
I want what You want Lord and nothing less


When You don&#39;t move the mountains I&#39;m needing You to move
When You don&#39;t part the waters I wish I could walk through
When You don&#39;t give the answers as I cry out to You
I will trust, I will trust, I will trust in You!


I will trust in You!
You are my strength and comfort
You are my steady hand
You are my firm foundation; the rock on which I stand


Your ways are always higher
Your plans are always good
There&#39;s not a place where I&#39;ll go, You&#39;ve not already stood


When You don&#39;t move the mountains I&#39;m needing You to move
When You don&#39;t part the waters I wish I could walk through
When You don&#39;t give the answers as I cry out to You
I will trust, I will trust, I will trust in You!


I will trust in You!
I will trust in You!
I will trust in You!
