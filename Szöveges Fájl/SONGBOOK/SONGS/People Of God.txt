People Of God

We&#39;re the people of God
Called by His name
Called from the dark
And delivered from shame
One holy race saints ev&#39;ryone
Because of the blood
Of Christ Jesus the Son


With our lips
Let us sing one confession
With our hearts
Hold to one truth alone
For He has erased our transgression
Claimed us and called us
His own His very own


Hear us O spirits of darkness
So you will know where we stand
We are His servants purchased with scars
Bought by the blood of the Lamb
The blood of the Lamb
