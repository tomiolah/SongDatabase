My God is so big

/: My God is so big, so strong and so mighty
There&#39;s nothing my God cannot do. :/


In the beginning
God made everything
God simply spoke
And the world came to being
He sent a flood
And made everything new
He parted the sea
And let His people walk through


He helped a boy
To bring a giant right down
Joshua marched
The walls fell to the ground
These acts of power
Are worthy of praise
But if you want to question
My God and His ways
(I&#39;ll look you in the eye and say:)


/: My God is so big, so strong and so mighty
There&#39;s nothing my God cannot do. :/


Though we are sinners
He still gave us worth
God sent His Son
To live here on the earth
He healed the sick
He made blind men see
He let the lame walk
And He set the world free


He died on a cross
And He rose from the grave
He conquered sin
He is mighty to save
He went to heaven
And He&#39;s coming back
God&#39;s word is true
But if it&#39;s attacked
(I&#39;ll look you in the eye and say:)


/: My God is so big, so strong and so mighty
There&#39;s nothing my God cannot do. :/


God, the Spirit
God, the Father
God, the Son
One, plus one, plus, one equals one.


I want the world
To know about my God
I want to live
So the whole word can see
That my heart is changed
I&#39;m forgiven and new
If people need proof
May they see it in me
(Let&#39;s look the world in the eye
Let&#39;s look them in the eye and say:)


/: My God is so big, so strong and so mighty
There&#39;s nothing my God cannot do. :/
