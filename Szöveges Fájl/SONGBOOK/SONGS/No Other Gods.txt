No Other Gods

We will have no other gods before You
Nothing on earth will compete for Your throne
You are sov&#39;reign I Am
And You reign in our hearts alone
We will exalt You on high forever
King of all kings
And the Lord of all lords
We will have no other gods before You


The God of the heavens
The Ancient of Days
The God of our fathers
And God of my praise
The Alpha Omega
Beginning and End
Forever and ever
Your kingdom will stand
We come to bow before You now
We come to lay our lives down


Our Maker Creator
Before time began
Messiah and Savior
Redeemer and Friend
Our Rock of Salvation
So faithful and true
We give all the glory
And honor to You
For You alone are worthy
Of our never-ending love
