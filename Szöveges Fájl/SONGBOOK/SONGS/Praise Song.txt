Praise Song

And we know that You are our Savior
And we know that You are the Son
And we know that You are the Savior
Of everyone


We praise You O Lord
For the love that You give
And the time that You spent
On this world for our sins
We lift up Your name
In honor and praise
In Jesus we place
All our love and our faith


The time is now near
When You will appear
When we see Your face
And Your voice will appear
And then we will sing
To Jesus the King
The Maker
Creator of everything
