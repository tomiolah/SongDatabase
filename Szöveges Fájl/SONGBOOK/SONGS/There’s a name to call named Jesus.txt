There’s a name to call named Jesus

There’s a name to call named Jesus
There’s a way to go named Jesus
There’s a life to live named Jesus
He is love, He is love


He was dead and now he is alive
And I’m in him, and I’m in him.
And he raised up the dead out of the grave.
So I am saved, so I am saved.


There’s a hope to hope named Jesus
There’s a light to shine named Jesus
There’s a  pow’r  to work named Jesus
He is love, He is love.
