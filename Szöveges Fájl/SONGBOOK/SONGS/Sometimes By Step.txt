Sometimes By Step

/: Oh God You are my God
And I will ever praise You :/
I will seek You in the morning
And I will learn to walk in Your ways
And step by step You&#39;ll lead me
And I will follow You all of my days


Sometimes the night was beautiful
Sometimes the sky was so far away
Sometimes it seemed too steep
So close you could touch it
But your heart would break
Sometimes the morning came too soon
Sometimes the day could be so hard
There was so much work left to do
But so much you&#39;d already done


Sometimes I think of Abraham
How one star he saw had been lit for him
He was a stranger in this land
And I am that no less than he
And on this road to righteousness
Sometimes the climb can be steep
I may falter in my steps
But never beyond reach
