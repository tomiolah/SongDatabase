O for a thousand tongues to sing

O for a thousand tongues to sing
my great Redeemer&#39;s praise,
the glories of my God and King,
the triumphs of his grace!


Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease;
’Tis music in the sinner’s ears,
’Tis life, and health, and peace.


See all your sins on Jesus laid:
The Lamb of God was slain,
His soul was once an offering made
For every soul of man.


He breaks the power of canceled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me.


He speaks, and, listening to His voice,
New life the dead receive,
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
The humble poor believe.


Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Savior come,
And leap, ye lame, for joy.


My gracious Master and my God,
assist me to proclaim,
to spread thro&#39; all the earth abroad
the honors of your name.
