Shout To The Lord

My Jesus, my Savior,
Lord, there is none like You;
All of my days
I want to praise
The wonders of Your mighty love.


My comfort, my shelter,
Tower of refuge and strength;
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship You.


Shout to the Lord, all the earth,
Let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the King;
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of Your name.


I sing for joy at the work of Your hands,
Forever I&#39;ll love You, forever I&#39;ll stand,
Nothing compares to the promise I have in You.
