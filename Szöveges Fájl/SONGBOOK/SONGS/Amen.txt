Amen

Count to three and say a prayer
Down for love and up for air
Underwater, overjoyed
Water for a thirsty soul
Water for a thirsty soul


Baptize me into Your love
Oh, my spirit&#39;s overcome
Body, mind, and skin, bone
Love Him, wanna make it known
Love Him, wanna make it known


I&#39;m comin&#39; alive, with You
I&#39;m comin&#39; alive, with You
I was livin&#39; a lie, &#39;til you
I&#39;m comin&#39; alive, with You


All the people say
Amen! Amen!
All the people say
Amen! Amen! Amen!
Yeah!


Resurrection day is here
Bells are ringin&#39; loud and clear
Caterpillar to a butterfly
Reason to another life
Reason to another life


Yeah, I&#39;m comin&#39; alive, with You
I&#39;m comin&#39; alive, with You
I was livin&#39; a lie, &#39;til you
I&#39;m comin&#39; alive, with You


All the people say
Amen! Amen!
All the people say
Amen! Amen! Amen!
Yeah!
Amen!
From death to life (Amen!)
From dark to light (Amen!)
I&#39;m singin&#39; out tonight (Amen! Amen!)


You&#39;re in my blood, my veins
In every word I pray
You gave it all for me
I&#39;ll give it all for You
Oh, I&#39;m in love with You
Overwhelmed by You
And if the world is listenin&#39;
This is my confession
You are my obsession


All the people say
Amen! Amen!
All the people say
Amen! Amen! Amen!
Yeah!
Amen!
From death to life (Amen!)
From dark to light (Amen!)
I&#39;m singin&#39; out tonight (Amen! Amen!)
Yeah!
