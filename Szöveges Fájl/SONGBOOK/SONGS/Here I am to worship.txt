Here I am to worship

Light of the world, You step down into darkness.
Open my eyes let me see.
Beauty that made this heart adore you
Hope of a life spent with you.


Here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that you&#39;re my God,
You&#39;re altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.


King of all days,
So highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above.
Humbly you came to the earth you created.
All for love&#39;s sake became poor.


So, here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that you&#39;re my God,
You&#39;re altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.


And I&#39;ll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross.
And I&#39;ll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross.


I&#39;ll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross.
I&#39;ll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross.


Here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that you&#39;re my God.
You&#39;re altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.


So, here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that you&#39;re my God.
You&#39;re altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.
