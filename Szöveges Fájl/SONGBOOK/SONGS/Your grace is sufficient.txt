Your grace is sufficient

Your grace is sufficient for me
Your strength is made perfect when I am weak
All that I cling to
I lay at your feet
Your grace is sufficient for me


I&#39;m no longer striving
To merit Your love
I rest in your promise to me
All of my sins have been
Washed in Your blood
Your mercy is all that I need


You see me as righteous
Because of the blood
That made the atonement for me
Your mercy has triumphed where I should be judged
So now by your grace I am free
