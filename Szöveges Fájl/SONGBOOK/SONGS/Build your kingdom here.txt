Build your kingdom here

Come set Your rule and reign
In our hearts again
Increase in us we pray
Unveil why we&#39;re made.


Come set our hearts ablaze with hope
Like wildfire in our very souls
Holy Spirit come invade us now.


We are Your Church
And we need Your power
In us.


We seek Your kingdom first
We hunger and we thirst
Refuse to waste our lives
For You&#39;re our joy and prize.


To see the captive hearts released
The hurt, the sick, the poor at peace
We lay down our lives for Heaven&#39;s cause.


We are Your church
And we pray revive
This earth (We&#39;re prayin&#39; for revival).


Build Your kingdom here
Let the darkness fear
Show Your mighty hand
Heal our streets and land.


Set Your church on fire
Win this nation back
Change the atmosphere
Build Your kingdom here
We pray.


Unleash Your kingdom&#39;s power
Reaching the near and far
No force of hell can stop
Your beauty changing hearts
You made us for much more than this.


Awake the kingdom seed in us
Fill us with the strength and love of Christ
We are Your church
Oh, and we are the hope
On earth.


Build Your kingdom here
Let the darkness fear
Show Your mighty hand
Heal our streets and land.


Set Your church on fire
Win this nation back
Change the atmosphere
Build Your kingdom here
We pray.
