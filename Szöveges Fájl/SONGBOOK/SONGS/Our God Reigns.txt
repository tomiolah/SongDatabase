Our God Reigns

So much holy
So divine
Yours and so much mine
By the morning
Light is thine
Perfect by design


Mighty to men
Light of the earth
Sending the son
To echo his worth
Breaker of sin
Winner of souls
Every creature will know


Our God Reigns
Over the Heavens
Over the earth
Our God reigns
Praise His name
All still standing
All that was, all that remains
Our God reigns
(He reigns)


In devotion
To His bride
Standing by her side
Mighty to men
Light of the earth
Sending the son
To echo his worth
Breaker of sin
Winner of souls
Every creature will know
