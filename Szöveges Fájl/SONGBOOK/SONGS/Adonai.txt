Adonai

Lord of eternity,
Mystery behind the veil,
Lord over heaven and earth,
God of Israel.


Come with Your wisdom and power,
Clothed in Your honor and strength,
Lord, hear the cry of our hearts,
Come, O conquering King!
And every eye will see
Your glory fill the skyâ€¦


Adonai! Adonai!
Every knee will bow to You,
Lord Most High!
Adonai! Adonai!
You alone are God
Every tongue will cry,
Adonai!


Here Jerusalem waits,
Praises lifted on high.
Here the beautiful gates
Long to see you arise!
When all of Zion sings,
&quot;Blessed Is the Lord!&quot;


/: You are Lord over all the earth. :/ 8x
