The Redeemer Is Here

Holy Lamb
Who died for love
Holy Spirit
Here with us
We are humbled
On our knees
Lord here we are
Surrendering


The redeemer is here
And the moment is now
His love for us is real
With one voice, we cry out
Loud and clear
The Redeemer is here


Bridge
You are the risen one
You are emmanuel
With your grace and forgiveness
Heal us Lord Jesus We cry out


The redeemer is here/ You are the risen one
And the moment is now/ You are emmanuel
His love for us is real/ With your grace and forgiveness
With one voice, we cry out/ Heal us Lord Jesus We cry out


The redeemer is here/ You are the risen one
And the moment is now/ You are emmanuel
His love for us is real/ With your grace and forgiveness
With one voice, we cry out/ Heal us Lord Jesus We cry out
Loud and clear
The Redeemer is here
