He Lives

I&#39;ve got something to sing about
I&#39;ve got something to shout about
I&#39;ve got something to tell the world about
I&#39;ve got something to live for
I&#39;ve got something worth dying for
I&#39;ve got something to tell the world about


He lives He lives I know my Savior lives
He lives He lives His life has set me free
I&#39;ve got something to sing about
I&#39;ve got something to shout about
I&#39;ve got something to tell the world about
I stand here forgiven
Abundant life I&#39;m liven&#39;
Because He lives all these things I&#39;ve found


BRIDGE
There have been many who claimed
That they were God but in those graves
Their bones remain but in the tomb
Where my Jesus once was laid
There&#39;s nothing there that&#39;s why I have to say
