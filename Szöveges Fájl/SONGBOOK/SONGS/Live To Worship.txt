Live To Worship

We will live to worship
Give You praise with all our hearts
For all our days
Father we want to do what You created us to
We will live to worship You


A simple offering is all that we bring
We give our lives claim You as King
We are Your servants and before You we bow
With ev&#39;ry breath we make this vow


Our ev&#39;ry moment is a gift of Your grace
We are all Yours now and always
More than just words O Lord
The cry of our hearts
Is to let our lives speak of how great You are


BRIDGE
For You are worthy
You alone are deserving
You are holy
You alone are deserving


ENDING
Holy worthy
Holy worthy Lord
We will live to worship You
