Hope To Carry On

Love has come
Love has come
Love has come
And it&#39;s given me hope to carry on


I can see Jesus hanging on the cross
I can see Jesus hanging on the cross
I can see Jesus hanging on the cross
He came looking for the lost


I can hear Jesus saying Father forgive
I can hear Jesus saying Father forgive
I can hear Jesus saying Father forgive
What a thing He did


Bridge
I can see love
Love is all I want to see
Love could make a beggar rich
He could set prisoner free
I know He could do it for you
God knows He did it for me
I can see love
Love is all I want to show you
Love love&#39;s the only way to go love
Love is all a man might need to know
This I know


You know Peter put away his sword
I can see Peter he&#39;s putting away his sword
I can see Peter he put away his sword
He won&#39;t fight no more
