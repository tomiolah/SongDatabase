God will take care of you

1. Be not dismayed whate’er betide,
God will take care of you;
Beneath his wings of love abide,
God will take care of you.


Refrain:
God will take care of you,
Through ev&#39;ry day,
O’er all the way;
He will take care of you,
God will take care of you.


2. Through days of toil when heart does fail,
God will take care of you;
When dangers fierce your path assail,
God will take care of you.


3. All you may need he will provide,
God will take care of you;
Nothing you ask will be denied,
God will take care of you.


4. No matter what may be the test,
God will take care of you;
Lean, weary one, upon his breast,
God will take care of you.
