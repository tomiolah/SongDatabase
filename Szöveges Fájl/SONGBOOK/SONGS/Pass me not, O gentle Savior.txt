Pass me not, O gentle Savior

Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.


Savior, Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.


Thou the spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heaven but Thee?
