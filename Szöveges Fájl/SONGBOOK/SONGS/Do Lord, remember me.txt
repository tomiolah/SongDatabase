Do Lord, remember me

Do Lord, oh, do Lord, oh, do Lord, oh, do Lord,


Do Lord, oh, do Lord, oh, do remember me,
Do Lord, oh, do Lord, oh, do remember me, I&#39;m praying
Do Lord, oh, do Lord, oh, do remember me,
Way beyond the blue.


Now I&#39;ve got a home in glory land, that outshines the sun
I&#39;ve got a home in glory land, that outshines the sun
I&#39;ve got a home in glory land, that outshines the sun
Way beyond the blue,
beyond the blue, I&#39;m singing


Well I took Jesus as my Savior, you take Him too,
I took Jesus as my Savior, you take Him too,
I took Jesus as my Savior, you take Him too,
While He&#39;s calling you,
He&#39;s calling you, I&#39;m singing
