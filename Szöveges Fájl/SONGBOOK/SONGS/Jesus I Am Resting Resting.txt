Jesus I Am Resting Resting

Jesus I am resting resting
In the joy of what Thou art
I am finding out the greatness
Of Thy loving heart


Jesus I am resting resting
In the joy of what Thou art
I am finding out the greatness
Of Thy loving heart
Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee
And Thy beauty fills my soul
For by Thy transforming power
Thou hast made me whole


Oh how great Thy loving kindness
Vaster broader than the sea
Oh how marvelous Thy goodness
Lavished all on me
Yes I rest in Thee Beloved
Know what wealth of grace is Thine
Know Thy certainty of promise
And have made it mine


Simply trusting Thee Lord Jesus
I behold Thee as Thou art
And Thy love so pure so changeless
Satisfies my heart
Satisfies its deepest longings
Meets supplies its ev&#39;ry need
Compasseth me &#39;round with blessings
Thine is love indeed


Ever lift Thy face upon me
As I work and wait for Thee
Resting &#39;neath Thy smile Lord Jesus
Earth&#39;s dark shadows flee
Brightness of my Father&#39;s glory
Sunshine of my Father&#39;s face
Keep me ever trusting resting
Fill me with Thy grace
