Nothing Compares

(But) nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You Lord
Oh no and nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You Lord
Oh no


Well I&#39;ve heard all the stories
And I&#39;ve seen all the signs
Witnessed all the glory
And tasted all that&#39;s fine


I see all the people
Wasting all their time
Building up their riches
For a life that&#39;s fine


BRIDGE
And I find myself just living for today
&#39;Cause I don&#39;t know what
Tomorrow&#39;s gonna bring
So no matter if I rise or fall
I&#39;ll never be alone woah no
Not alone
