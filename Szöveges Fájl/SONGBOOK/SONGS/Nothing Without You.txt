Nothing Without You

Take these hands
And lift them up
For I have not the strength
To praise You near enough
See I have nothing
I have nothing
Without You


And take my voice
And pour it out
Let it sing
The songs of mercy I have found
For I have nothing
I have nothing
Without You


And all my soul needs
Is all Your love to cover me
So all the world will see
That I have nothing without You


Take my body
And build it up
May it be broken as
An offering of love
For I have nothing
I have nothing
Without You


Bridge
But I love You yeah
With all my heart
With all my soul
With all my mind
And all the strength
That I can find


End
Take my time here on this earth
And let it glorify
All that You are worth
For I am nothing
I am nothing
Without You
