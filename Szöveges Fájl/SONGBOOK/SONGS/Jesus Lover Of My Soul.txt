Jesus Lover Of My Soul

Jesus, Lover of my soul,
Jesus, I will never let you go
You&#39;ve taken me from the miry clay
You&#39;ve set my feet upon the Rock, and now I know.


I love you, I need you,
Though my world may fall, I&#39; ll never let you go
My Saviour, my closest friend,
I will worship you until the very end.
