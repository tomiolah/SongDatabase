Just a Little Talk With Jesus

I once was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul;
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus makes me whole


Now let us, Have a little talk with Jesus
Let us, tell Him all about our troubles
He will, Hear our faintest cry
And He will, answer by and by;
Now when you, Feel a little pary&#39;r wheel turning
And you, know a little fire is burning
You will, Find a little talk with Jesus makes it right


I may have doubts and fears, my eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night;
I go to him in prayer, He knows my every care
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right


Sometimes my path seems drear, without a ray of cheer
And then a cloud of doubt may hide the light of day;
The mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way
