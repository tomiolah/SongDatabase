Soon And Very Soon

Soon and very soon,
We are going to see the King,
Soon and very soon,
We are going to see the King.
Soon and very soon,
We are going to see the King,
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
We are going to see the King.


No more crying there,
We are going to see the King,
No more crying there,
We are going to see the King.
No more crying there,
We are going to see the King,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
We are going to see the King.


Hallelujah.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah.


No more dying there,
We are going to see the King,
No more dying there,
We are going to see the King.
No more dying there,
We are going to see the King,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
We are going to see the King.


Hallelujah.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah.


Should there be any rivers we must cross,
Should there be any mountains we must climb,
God will supply all the strength that we need,
Give us grace ’til we reach the other side.
We have come from every nation,
God knows each of us by name.
Jesus took His blood and He washed our sins,
And He washed them all away.
Yes, there are some of us,
Who have laid down our lives,
But we all shall live again,
On the other side.


Soon and very soon,
We are going to see the King,
Soon and very soon,
We are going to see the King.
Soon and very soon,
We are going to see the King,
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
We are going to see the King.


Hallelujah.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah.
Hallelujah.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah.
Hallelujah.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Hallelu…
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah.
