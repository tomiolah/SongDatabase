Potter&#39;s Hand

Beautiful Lord, Wonderful savior
I know for sure all of my days are held in your hands
Crafted into your perfect plan


You gently called me into your presence
Guiding me by Your Holy Spirit
Teach me dear Lord to live all of my life
Through your eyes.


I&#39;m captured by your holy calling
Set me apart. I know you&#39;re calling me to yourself
Lead me, Lord. I pray


Take me, mold me, use me, fill me
I give my life to the potter&#39;s hand


Call me, guide me, lead me, walk beside me
I give my life to the potter&#39;s hand
