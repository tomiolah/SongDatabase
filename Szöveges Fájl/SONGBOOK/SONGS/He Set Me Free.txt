He Set Me Free

He set me free
Yes He set me free
And He broke the bonds
Of prison for me
I&#39;m glory bound
My Jesus to see
For glory to God
He set me free


Once like a bird
In prison I dwelt
No freedom
From my sorrow I felt
But Jesus came
And listened to me
And glory to God
He set me free


Now I am climbing
Higher each day
Darkness of night
Has drifted away
My feet are planted
On higher ground
And glory to God
I&#39;m homeward bound


Good-bye to sin
And things that confound
Naught of the world
Shall turn me around
Daily I&#39;m working
I&#39;m praying too
And glory to God
I&#39;m going thru
