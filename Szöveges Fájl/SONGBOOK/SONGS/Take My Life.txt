Take My Life

Please take from me my life
When I don&#39;t have the strength
To give it away to You
Please take from me my life
When I don&#39;t have the strength
To give it away to You Jesus


How many times
Have I turned away
The number is the same
As the sand on the shore
Every time You&#39;ve taken me back
And now I pray
You&#39;ll do it once more


How many times
Have I gone astray
The number is the same
As the stars in the sky
Every time You&#39;ve taken me back
And now I pray
You&#39;ll do it tonight
