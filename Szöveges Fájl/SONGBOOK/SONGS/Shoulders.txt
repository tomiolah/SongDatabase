Shoulders

I look up to the mountains
Does my strength come from the mountains?
No, my strength comes from God
Who made heaven, and earth, and the mountains


When confusion&#39;s my companion
And despair holds me for ransom
I will feel no fear
I know that You are near


When I&#39;m caught deep in the valley
With chaos for my company
I&#39;ll find my comfort here
‘Cause I know that You are near


My help comes from You
You&#39;re right here, pulling me through
You carry my weakness, my sickness, my brokenness all on Your shoulders
Your shoulders


My help comes from You
You are my rest, my rescue
I don&#39;t have to see to believe that You&#39;re lifting me up on Your shoulders
Your shoulders


You mend what once was shattered
And You turn my tears to laughter
Your forgiveness is my fortress
Oh Your mercy is relentless


My help comes from You
You&#39;re right here, pulling me through
You carry my weakness, my sickness, my brokenness all on Your shoulders
Your shoulders


My help comes from You
You are my rest, my rescue
I don&#39;t have to see to believe that You&#39;re lifting me up on Your shoulders
Your shoulders


/: My help is from You
Don&#39;t have to see it to believe it
My help is from you
Don&#39;t have to see it, ‘cause I know, ‘cause I know it&#39;s true :/
