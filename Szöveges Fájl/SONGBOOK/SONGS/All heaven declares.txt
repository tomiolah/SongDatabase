All heaven declares

All heaven declares
The glory of the risen Lord
Who can compare with
The beauty of the Lord


Forever He will be
The Lamb upon the throne
I gladly bow the knee
And worship Him alone


I will proclaim
The glory of the risen Lord
Who once was slain
To reconcile man to God


Forever You will be
The Lamb upon the throne
I gladly bow the knee
And worship You alone
